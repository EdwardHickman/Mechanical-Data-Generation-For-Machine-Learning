# About
This is a Python tool that gathers stress-strain data of a requested material through the use of web scraping. After entering a material name into the search bar, it will search for the material's corresponding stress-strain graphs. Selecting any graph will open up the corresponding csv file.

# Usage
- Enter the name of a material in the search bar.
- Please wait a moment while the tool searches for the data. Searching time is dependent on how much data is available for the requested material.
- After the grid-view of the curves appear, click on any image to immediately show the .csv file containing 1000 points of data.
